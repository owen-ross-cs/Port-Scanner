# Port-Scanner

## Objective
For this project I created a port scanner in Python from scratch using the socket library. This project is not meant to create a better port scanner than the ones that are widely used in the industry like Nmap, instead it was meant to showcase my knowledge of the port scanning process, that is a vital task of the reconisance phase of pen testing.
